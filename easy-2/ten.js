// Write a function that takes a string of digits, and returns the appropriate number as an integer. The string may have a leading + or - sign; if the first character is a +, your function should return a positive number; if it is a -, your function should return a negative number. If no sign is given, you should return a positive number.

// You may not use any of the standard conversion methods available in JavaScript, such as parseInt() and Number(). You may, however, use the stringToInteger() function from the previous lesson.
